# Pokemon AR - TIA Project

Pokemon AR is an online Augmented Reality game in which you can fight your friends by simply using the back of any official Pokemon Card. Once the card is placed you will only have to select a pokemon from the list, or name it by voice and fight!

This project was developed with the idea of bringing Pokemon to Augmented Reality but with the Pokemon Stadium gameplay. It can be controlled both by the mobile's touch screen and by voice commands, which recognize which pokemon you are using and which attack you want to use.
